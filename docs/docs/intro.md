LLMRTC is a TypeScript SDK for building real-time voice and vision applications with WebRTC, LLMs, STT, and TTS. It provides a unified orchestrator, a production-ready backend, and a WebRTC web client so you can ship low-latency conversational agents fast.

**What you get**
- WebRTC audio/video streaming with built-in VAD and barge-in
- Provider-agnostic LLM/STT/TTS/Vision abstractions (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, OpenRouter, local)
- Tool calling + playbooks for multi-stage flows
- Streaming pipelines end-to-end (STT → LLM → TTS) with reconnection and session persistence

**Who this is for**
- Teams building voice assistants, support bots, IVR replacements, multimodal agents, or on-device / local-first experiences.
