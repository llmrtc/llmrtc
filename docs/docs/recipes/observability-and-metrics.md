title: Observability & Metrics
---

Based on [`examples/observability`](https://github.com/llmrtc/llmrtc/tree/main/examples/observability).

Shows
- Hooking into transcripts, tool calls, and provider durations
- Emitting metrics to the console (or forward to Prometheus/OTel)
- Structured logging for each turn

Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Use this as a starting point to wire your own logging/metrics backend.
