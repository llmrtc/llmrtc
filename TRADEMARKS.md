# LLMRTC Trademark and Branding Policy

This document explains how you may use the names and branding associated with the **LLMRTC** project and with
**Next Path Software Consulting Inc., doing business as “Metered”** (“Metered”, “we”, or “us”).

This policy is **separate from**, and does **not modify**, the software license for LLMRTC.

- The `LICENSE` file governs your rights to use the **code** (Apache License 2.0).
- This policy governs your use of our **names, logos, and other marks**.

If there is any conflict between this policy and the Apache 2.0 license, the license controls with respect to
your rights to the software.

## Our Marks

For purposes of this policy, **“Marks”** includes:

- The word marks: **“Metered”**, **“LLMRTC”**, and **“Next Path Software Consulting”**;
- Any Metered/LLMRTC product names;
- The Metered logos and any associated trade dress or visual identity.

Metered owns all rights, title, and interest in the Marks. Nothing in the Apache 2.0 license transfers ownership
of the Marks.

## Relationship to the Apache 2.0 License

The LLMRTC source code is licensed under the **Apache License, Version 2.0**.

The Apache 2.0 license is permissive, but it also makes clear that it **does not grant permission to use**
a licensor’s trade names or trademarks except for reasonable, customary use in describing the origin of the work
and reproducing the content of a `NOTICE` file (if present).

This policy explains what we consider acceptable and unacceptable use of Metered/LLMRTC branding.

## Uses Allowed Without Prior Permission

Subject to the restrictions below, you may use our Marks in the following ways **without prior written permission**:

### 1) Descriptive / nominative use

You may use the word marks “Metered” and “LLMRTC” to accurately refer to the upstream project, for example:

- “Built with LLMRTC”
- “Forked from Metered’s LLMRTC”
- “Compatible with LLMRTC”

Your use must be truthful and must **not** suggest sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation where none exists.

### 2) Editorial references and comparisons

You may use our Marks in blog posts, documentation, and comparisons in a purely descriptive/editorial way.

### 3) Unmodified logo in factual references

You may use an **unmodified** Metered logo in factual references (e.g., “technologies used” slides), provided that:

- The logo is not altered (other than proportional resizing), and
- The use does not imply that Metered sponsors, endorses, or is responsible for your project.

---

## Uses Requiring Prior Written Permission

You **must obtain our written permission** before you:

- Use any Mark as part of your **company**, **product**, **service**, or **domain** name
  (e.g., “LLMRTC Hosting”, “MeteredRTC”, or `metered-rtc.example`);
- Create logos or branding that are confusingly similar to our Marks;
- Display our Marks prominently in marketing, websites, app listings, or ads in a way that could suggest a partnership
  or endorsement.

To request permission, contact:

- contact@llmrtc.org

## Prohibited Uses

You **may not**:

- Use the Marks in any way that is false, misleading, defamatory, or unlawful;
- Modify Metered logos (other than proportional resizing) or create confusingly similar logos;
- Present your project, fork, company, or service as **“Metered”**, **“LLMRTC”**, or an official Metered/LLMRTC product
  if it is not;
- Use our Marks in a way likely to cause confusion about the source of software or services.

---

## Forks and Derivative Projects

Forks are allowed under Apache 2.0. However, trademark rules still apply.

If you publish a fork or derivative project:

1) **Choose a distinct name.**
   - Do not use “Metered” or “LLMRTC” as the primary name or branding of your fork.
   - Do not use the Metered logo.

2) **Do not imply endorsement.**
   - Clearly state that your project is an independent fork and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Metered.

3) **Recommended fork attribution.**
   - In the top-level README (or equivalent), include a statement such as:

     > “This is an independent fork of LLMRTC, originally developed by Metered.”

This recommendation is meant to reduce market confusion and to ensure users can find the official upstream project.

---

## No Transfer or Waiver

Nothing in this policy transfers ownership of any Mark or grants rights beyond those explicitly stated here or
allowed by applicable trademark law.

We may update this policy from time to time. Continued use of the Marks after an update constitutes acceptance
of the updated policy for future uses.
